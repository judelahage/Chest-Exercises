            The incline bench press is a variation of the traditional bench press that targets the upper portion of the pectoral muscles and the anterior deltoids (shoulders). The individual lies on an incline bench, which is typically set at an angle between 30 and 45 degrees. Holding a barbell or a pair of dumbbells at shoulder width, they lower the weight to the upper chest and then push it back up until the arms are fully extended. This exercise allows for a greater range of motion compared to the flat bench press and can help develop a well-rounded and balanced upper body. As with all exercises, it's crucial to maintain proper form and control the weight to prevent injury.
