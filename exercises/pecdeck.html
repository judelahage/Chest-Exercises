            The pec deck exercise is a popular isolation movement that specifically targets the pectoral muscles, or the chest. The individual sits on the machine with their back flat against the pad and places their forearms on the padded levers. They then bring the levers together in a hugging motion, squeezing the chest muscles at the peak of the movement. The levers are then slowly returned to the starting position, maintaining tension on the chest muscles throughout. This exercise is highly effective for building chest muscle definition and strength, but it's important to use a weight that allows for control and full range of motion to avoid injury.
