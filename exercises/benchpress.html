        The bench press is a weight training exercise that targets the muscles of the upper body, primarily the pectorals (chest), triceps (back of the arms), and anterior deltoids (shoulders). 
        The individual lies on their back on a bench, with a weighted barbell held at arm's length above the chest. 
        The barbell is then lowered to the chest, and pushed back up until the arms are fully extended. 
        The bench press is a compound movement, meaning it works multiple muscle groups at once, and is a staple in many strength and bodybuilding programs. 
        It's important to use proper form and control the weight to avoid injury. ddddd
