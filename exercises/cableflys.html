            The cable fly is an isolation exercise that primarily targets the pectoral muscles of the chest. The individual stands in the middle of a cable machine, grasps the handles of the high pulleys and steps forward to create tension. With a slight bend in the elbows, they pull the handles together in a wide arc until they meet in front of the body, squeezing the chest muscles at the peak of the movement. The handles are then slowly returned to the starting position, maintaining constant tension on the chest muscles. This exercise allows for a great range of motion and can help enhance chest muscle definition and strength. As with all exercises, it's important to use a controlled motion and appropriate weight to avoid injury.
